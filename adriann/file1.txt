SSL/TLS, the guardian of the net,
Ensuring secure connections, we can bet.
Encryption keys, a secret set,
Protecting our data, without regret.
Handshakes and certificates, a careful art,
Creating a tunnel, tearing data apart.
No eavesdroppers, playing their part,
Secure communication, a brand new start.
With algorithms strong, and protocols tight,

SSL/TLS ensures a safe, digital light.
In online transactions, shining bright,
Protecting our secrets, with all its might.
