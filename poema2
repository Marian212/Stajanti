Ensures order, a reliable gleam.
Packets are sent, a measured pace,
Segments reassembled, find their place.
With acknowledgments, a careful grace,
No loss of data, time cannot erase.
IP, the guide, across the wire so vast,
Reaches the destination, holding steadfast.
A network symphony, forever to last,
In this digital dance, knowledge amassed.
