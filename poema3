HTTP, the language of the web we know,
Requests and responses, a graceful flow.
Client-server dance, a constant show,
Where information travels to and fro.
From browser to server, the message sent,
A web page rendered, time well spent.
With headers and body, content is lent,
A digital tapestry, elegantly sent.
HTTPS adds security, a watchful eye,
Protecting our data, as it passes by.
In this digital world, so vast and high,
HTTP empowers, reaching for the sky.
