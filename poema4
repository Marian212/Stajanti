SSL/TLS, the guardian of the net,
Ensuring secure connections, we can bet.
Encryption keys, a secret set,
Protecting our data, without regret.
Handshakes and certificates, a careful art,
Creating a tunnel, tearing data apart.



SSL/TLS ensures a safe, digital light.
In online transactions, shining bright,
Protecting our secrets, with all its might.
